This is a web application on which users order masks for the hospitals they manage. It features a landing page, a registration/ login page, a hospital management page and a page to order masks for your appointed hospitals. After ordering it will generate an invoice as a pdf which you can download. Then the stock which is visible on the order page will update to the new value. If you are trying to order more masks then available then your order will get the maximum value possible and wait for confirmation.
